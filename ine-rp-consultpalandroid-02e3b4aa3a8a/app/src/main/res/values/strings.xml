<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please begin with your main health concern. If you have other problems that you would like to discuss, just enter them in the other boxes. </span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I put the wrong problem in the wrong box.</i></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That\’s OK. Just drag the boxes into the order you would like.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Why are the boxes different colours?</i></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The box colour denotes the urgency of your health concern. The top box is red, which should indicate your main trouble.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I don\'t think the doctor has time to address my concerns.</i></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That may be the case today but it is important your doctor understands you better by becoming aware of these concerns. You may not think they are important but your doctor may be able to advise you on them, refer you to another professional, or ask you to return on another date to discuss them further. </span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I don\’t have time today to think about my problems and write them here.</i></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That\’s OK. We understand your health can be very complicated and may take more time to think about. If you want to, you can use this app at another location, in your own time, to enter your problems. You could even ask someone to help you.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>If I share my problems here, will my Doctor be able to see them, and what will they do with them?</i></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, your Doctor can view these problems any time, because they are stored on a safe and secure database. Your Doctor can copy these problems to your Electronic Patient Record, so they will be accessible in future to be able to offer you the best treatments based on this history.</span></p>
